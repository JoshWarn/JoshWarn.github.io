                <h3>Sequential Prime Spiral</h3>
                <p> A spiral made with arm lengths of the differences between successive primes -  with a 90 degree rotation after each segment. <br>
                    Plotted above are the segments for all primes below a hundred million.</p>

                <h3>Right-hand Truncatable Primes in Multiple Bases</h3>
                <p>This calculates RHT Primes (eg. 3, 37, 3733, 37337 in b-10) in a branching fashion. Due to the large Big O for bases, <br>
                    I implemented fully asynchronous multithreading, redundant task claiming, and various other optimizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, the largest base that has been fully computed is b-87 with a digit-length of 53 
                    - being approximatly 6.2*10^102. Due to the large size of the primes, determining primality can be slow even when 
                    using a probabilistic test such as Baillie-PSW. To negate this, I have written other methods
                    concerning individual digits - though they are only effective when the prime canidates are
                    sufficiently large.

                <h3>Basic Erosion</h3>
                <p>A mini-project with the goal of modeling simplified erosion. <br>
                    Expanding this process to include deposition, evaporation, <br>
                    and velocity-dependent erosion would be the next step.</p>
